# GOV.UK Knowledge Graph

Experiment with setting up a graph database containing (most of) the GOV.UK
content as a network of pages and hyperlinks, as well as other more "semantic"
objects such as Person or Organisation and relationships between them.

[This
version](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome?project=govuk-knowledge-graph)
of the Knowledge Graph is hosted on GCP (Google Cloud Platform). It replaces a
[previous version](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-knowledge-graph) that was
hosted on AWS (Amazon Web Services).
