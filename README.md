# GOV.UK Knowledge Graph on GCP

GOV.UK content data and cloud infrastructure for the [GovSearch][govsearch] app.

The Knowledge Graph is a representation of GOV.UK content that suits:

- searching for exact string matches
- exploring relations between parts, such as pages that link to YouTube, or
  incumbents of roles in DEFRA
- training and using Named Entity Recognition models
- matching paragraphs within a page
- bulk usage

It is hosted on GCP (Google Cloud Platform). A [previous
implementation](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-knowledge-graph) was hosted on
AWS (Amazon Web Services).

## Background

There are several different representations of GOV.UK content, including:

- Publishing API
- Content Store
- Search API
- CDN cache (content delivery network)
- Mirror (HTML pages crawled nightly)
- National Archives (snapshots of content over time)

None of these representations met a need for advanced searching and filtering
for content designers, or a need for low-level structured data for developing
data science applications.  Hence the Knowledge Graph was developed.

This implementation of the knowledge graph primarily uses data from the Content
Store, supplemented by other sources.  It has been developed to support the
[GovSearch][govsearch] app in particular, as well as to make structured content
data easily accessible in bulk.
