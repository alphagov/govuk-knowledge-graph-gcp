# GOV.UK Knowledge Graph

* GOV.UK content data in BigQuery, for analytical workloads.
* Cloud infrastructure for the [GovSearch][govsearch] app.

## Documentation

Most documentation is in `README.md` files and [`docs`][docs] directory in this repository.  There is also [GOV.UK Data Community Technical Documentation][data-community-docs].

## Access and permissions

People are granted access by membership of Google Groups.  Other Google Cloud Platform projects are granted access via service accounts.  Access is granted by editing each environment's tfvars file, such as `terraform-dev/environment.auto.tfvars`.

### Google Groups

* [govsearch-data-viewers][govsearch-data-viewers] has `roles/bigquery.dataViewer` in relation to each BigQuery dataset, and `roles/bigquery.jobUser` to be able to run queries that are billed to the billing account of the `govuk-knowledge-graph*` projects.
* [govsearch-developers][govsearch-developers] has the `roles/owner` role in relation to each `govuk-knowledge-graph*` project.

## Tests

There are hardly any tests.

### SQL

The most likely cause of an error in GovSearch queries is a change to the data and document schemas in the Publishing API.

It is difficult, in general, to test chains of SQL statements.  DBT is popular for doing so, but adds a considerable abstraction, as well as requiring Python, which is discouraged in GOV.UK.

A [scheduled query][scheduled-query] runs every hour, and raises an error if any tables have zero rows or have not been updated in the past 25 hours.  The error is automatically detected in the logs, and an [alert][alert] is raised, which sends an email to the [govsearch-developers][govsearch-developers] Google Group.  Once the problem has been addressed, close the issue.

### Ruby

Two of the BigQuery Remote Functions are implemented in Ruby and have unit tests.  They are [parse-html](./src/cloud-functions/parse-html) and [html-to-text](./docker/html-to-text).  Other BigQuery Remote Functions are somewhat trivial.

## Maintainers

This project is maintained by the GOV.UK team, which is part of the Government Digital Service.

## Common tasks

### Import data from somewhere new

Look at https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-knowledge-graph-gcp/pull/594, which derives data from the Publisher app database and puts it into BigQuery.

## Other representations of GOV.UK content

There are several different representations of GOV.UK content, including:

- Publishing API
- Content Store
- Search API
- CDN cache (content delivery network)
- Mirror (HTML pages crawled nightly)
- National Archives (snapshots of content over time)

None of these representations met a need for advanced searching and filtering for content designers, or a need for low-level structured data for developing data science applications.  Hence the Knowledge Graph was developed.
